			</p>
				The Internet of Things , also called the Internet of Everything or the Industrial Internet, is a new technology paradigm envisioned as a global network of machines and devices capable of interacting with each other.
			<img src="120468-OPSATJ-716.jpg" alt="IOT" width=300px align="right">
			<BR CLEAR=”right” />
				Gartner forecasts that the IOT will reach 26 billion units by 2020, up from 0.9 billion in 2009, and will impact the information available to 		supply chain partners and how the supply chain operates.
				From production line and warehousing to retail delivery and store shelving, the IOT is transforming business processes by providing more accurate and 	real-time visibility into the flow of materials and products.
				In addition to manufacturers’ adoption of the IOT, various service industries are in the process of adopting the IOT to increase revenue through enhanced services and become leaders in their markets. RFID chips that serves as a ticket and connects to Disney’s data repository regarding park visitors.
				Kroger’s new IOT-based system, Retail Site Intelligence, is one complete retail platform of video analytics, wireless devices, POS devices, handheld sensors, IP cameras, and video management software that was designed to help customers have a better shopping experience by more easily finding the productsthey want and saving time at checkout.
				The adoption of this technology is rapidly gaining momentum as technological, societal, and competitive pressures push firms to innovate and transform themselves. As IOT technology advances and increasing numbers of firms adopt the technology, IOT cost-benefit analysis will become a subject of great interest. Because of the potential but uncertain benefits and high investment costs of the IOT, firms need to carefully assess every IOT-induced opportunity and challenge to ensure that their resources are spent judiciously.

			<p><p><h4>Five IOT technologies are widely used forthe deployment of successful IOT-based 
				products and services:</p></h4>

			<p id="R">
		<div class="A"> <h2><b>Radio frequency identification (RFID)</b></h2></div>
			<img src="smart-watch-contactless-cashless-payment.jpg" alt="IOT" width=150px align="right">
			</p>
			<p>
				allows automatic identification and data capture using radio waves, a tag, and a reader. The tag can store more data than traditional barcodes.
				Passive RFID tags rely on radio frequency energy transferred from the reader to the tag to power the tag; they are not battery-powered. Applications of these can be found in supply chains, passports, electronic tolls, and item-level tracking. Active RFID tags are used in manufacturing, hospital laboratories, and remote-sensing IT asset management.
			</p>
			<p id="W">
		<div class="A"> <h2><b>Wireless sensor networks (WSN)</b></h2></div>
			</p>
			<p>	
				Wireless sensor networks (WSN) consist of spatially
				distributed autonomous sensor-equipped devices to
				monitor physical or environmental &nbsp;&nbsp;conditions and can
			<img src="Capture.PNG" alt="IOT" width=150px align="left">
				cooperate with RFID systems to better track the
				status of things such as their location, temperature,
				&nbsp;&nbsp;and movements. WSN
				allow different network topologies and multihop
				communication. Recent technological advances in
				&nbsp;&nbsp;low-power integrated circuits and wireless communications have made available efficient, low-cost,
				low-power miniature &nbsp;&nbsp;devices for use in WSN applications .
				WSN have primarily been used in cold chain
				logisticsthat employ thermal and &nbsp;&nbsp;refrigerated packaging methods to transport temperature-sensitive
				products . WSN are also used for maintenance and
				&nbsp;&nbsp;tracking systems. For example, General Electric
				deploys sensors in its jet engines, turbines, and
				wind farms. By analyzing &nbsp;&nbsp;data in real time, GE saves
				time and money associated with preventive maintenance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, American Airlines uses sensors
			<br>capable of capturing 30 terabytes of data per flight
				for services such as preventive maintenance.
			</p>
			<p id="M">
		<div class="A"> <h2><b>Middleware</b></h2></div>
			</p>
			<p>
				Middleware is a software layer interposed between software applications to make it easier for software developers to perform communication and  .
			<img src="image-removebg-preview.png" alt="IOT" width=300px align="right">	
				input/ output. Middleware gained popularity in the 1980s due to its major role in simplifying the integration of legacy technologies into new ones. IOT with numerous heterogeneous devices requires simplifying the development of new applications and services, so the use of middleware
				is an ideal fit with IOT application development. For example, Global Sensor Networks is an open-source sensor middleware platform enabling the development and deployment of sensor services with almost zero programming effort.
			</p>
			<p id="C">
		<div class="A"> <h2><b>Cloud computing</b></h2></div>
			</p>
			<p>
			Cloud computing is a model for on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable resources that can be provisioned as Infrastructure as a Service or Software as a Service . One of the most important outcomes of the IOT is an enormous amount of data generated from devices connected to the Internet . Many IOT applications require massive data storage, huge processing speed to enable realtime decision making, and high-speed broadband networks to stream data, audio, or video
			</p>
			<p id="I">
		<div class="A"> <h2><b>IOT application software</b></h2></div>	
			</p>
			<p>
				The IOT facilitates the development of myriad industry-oriented and user-specific IOT applications. For example, transportation and logistics applications monitor the status of transported goods such as fruits, fresh-cut produce, meat, and dairy products. During transportation, the conservation status is monitored constantly and appropriate actions are taken automatically to avoid spoilage when the connection is out of range. While device-to-device applications do not necessarily require data visualization, more and more human-centred IOT applications provide 
				visualization to present information to end-users in an intuitive and easy-to-understand way and to allow interaction with the environment.

		<div id="IOT applications" class="tabcontent">
		<div class="A"> <h1><b>IOT applications to enhance customer value</b></h1></div>
			<p>
				Because the IOT is such a recent development, there is still a paucity of studies on the social, behavioral,
			<img src="15404.jpg" alt="IOT" width=100px align="right">
				economic, and managerial aspects of the IOT. This
				makes it very challenging for companies to make	
				informed decisions as regards IOT adoption/
				implementation. Our article is one ofthe firststudies
				on a conceptual model of IOT applications for enterprises.In this article we identified three categories of
				IOT applications: monitoring and control, big data
				and business analytics, and information sharing and
				collaboration. We also presented investment opportunities and investment evaluation with NPV and
				real options. Finally, we discussed five challenges
				in implementing IOT applications for enterprises.
			</p>
		<div class="A"> <h2><b>Monitoring and control</b></h2></div>	
			<p>
				The smart home is known to be at the forefront of innovation regarding IOT monitoring and control systems. The primary value propositions are 
			<img src="346991-PAW7ZF-72.jpg" alt="IOT" width=100px align="left">	
				&nbsp;&nbsp;family and property protection and energy savings. For example, the Verizon Home Monitoring and Control network uses a &nbsp;&nbsp;wireless communications technology designed specifically for remote control applications in home automation. IOT-enabled home &nbsp;&nbsp;appliances and devices can be monitored and controlled outside the user’s home through a computer, tablet, or smartphone. The primary customer value propositions are drivers’ personalized experience and satisfaction. The customer value propositions are &nbsp;&nbsp;appropriately integrated into the connected car environment to provide another revenue stream for Ford.
			</p>
		<div class="A"> <h2><b>Big data and business analytics</b></h2></div>
			<p>
				Business analytics tools may be embedded into IOT devices, such as wearable health monitoring sensors, so that real-time decision making can take place at the source of data. The IOT and advances in business analytics now make it possible to capture vast amounts of individual health data. IOT-based big data are also transforming the healthcare product industry. & Gamble developed the Oral-B Pro 5000 interactive electric 
		<img src="14826.jpg" alt="IOT" width=300px align="right">	 
				toothbrush to provide users with a smarter, more personalized oral care routine. The interactive electric toothbrush records brushing habits with mobile technology while giving mouth-care tips alongside news headlines. This innovation provides users with unprecedented control over
				their oral care.
			
		<div class="A"> <h2><b>Information sharing and collaboration</b></h2></div>		
			<p>
				Sensing a predefined event is usually the first step for information sharing and collaboration. In the supply chain area, information sharing and collaboration enhance situational awareness and avoid information delay and distortion.
				Shop Beacon provides Shop kick app users with personalized department-level deals, discounts, recommendations, and rewards. As shoppers enter Macy’s, shop  Beacon reminds those Shop kick app users who have opted in. In September 2014, following a pilot test of the application, Macy’s decided to roll out shop Beacon in all of its 4,000 U. Due to competitive pressure, there is expected to be rapid adoption of shop Beacon at other national retailers, too.

		<div id="Evolution of IOT" class="tabcontent">
		<div class="A"> <h1><b>Evolution of the foundational IOT technologies</b></h1></div>
			<p>
				Various types of IOTapplications have emerged, and
				the willingness of enterprises to utilize them is
				growing rapidly.the IOTwill generate $14.4 trillion in
				value; the combination of increased revenues and
				lower costs will migrate among companies and industries from 2013 to 2022. From an industry perspective, four industries make up more than half of
			<img src="fa1_fig01.jpg" alt="IOT" width=300px align="right">
				the $14.4 trillion in value. These leading four industries in terms of value at stake include manufacturing at 27%; retail trade at 11%; information services
				at 9%; and finance and insurance, also at 9%. Other
				industries such as wholesale, healthcare, and education lag behind in terms of value generation, with
				a range between 1% and 7%. Much of the value for
				manufacturers comes from greater agility and flexibility in factories, and from the ability to make the
				most of workers’skills. Additionally, a large amount
				of the value for retailers comes from connected
				marketing and advertising. Geographic distributions
				of the value are heavily driven by each region’s
				relative economic growth rate and by the relativesize of industry sector in each region. In the United
				States, $4.6 trillion of value is most prevalent in the
				services area. However, in China, $1.8 trillion of
				value is derived from rapid economic growth, mainly
				in the manufacturing sector.
				<a href="#1">Table 1</a> shows projected evolution in the area of
				foundational IOT technologies: network, software
				and algorithms, hardware, and data processing.
				The network is the backbone of the IOT. It refers
				to uniquely identifiable objects (things) and their
				virtual representations in an Internet-like structure.
				Network technology is moving to unobtrusive wirefree communication technology that allows deviceto-device applications to be deployed more flexibly.
				Network technology is evolving toward a contextaware autonomous network.
				Objects rely on software to communicate effectively with each other and to deliver enhanced
				functionality and connectivity. Software should
				be developed with the IOT’s interoperability,connectivity, privacy, and security requirements
				in mind. The focus of software development is
				shifting to user-oriented, distributed intelligence
				and machine-to-machine and machine-to-human
				collaboration.
				The news that Google is paying $3.2 billion in cash
				to buy Nest, a smart thermostat business, demonstrates the value of hardware in the IOT. Hardware is
				innovatively designed and robustly produced, driven
				by the consumerized IOT devices which have myriad
				features, functionalities, and operating environments. While RFID tags and sensors have been the
				focus of hardware innovation, miniaturization
				of hardware and nanotechnology is leading the
				energy-efficient, low-power hardware evolution.
				IOT devices generate enormous quantities of data
				that need to be aggregated and analyzed in real time
				to provide information regarding status, location,
				functionality, and environment of the devices. The
				traditional data processing method does not work
				well in the real-time streaming data process of the
				IOT environment. Since processing large quantities
				of IOT data in real time will increase workloads of
				data centers at an exponential rate, data processing
				will become more context-aware, optimized, and
				cognitive.
				In the IOT environment, a large number of
				devices are connected with each other, and it is not
				feasible to process all the streaming data available
				to those devices. Context-aware data processing
				enables sensors and devices to use context-specific
				information such as location, temperature, and the
				availability of a certain device to decide what data
				to collect and interpret to provide relevant information to other devices or users.

					 Real options can prove particularly valuable in fields of high uncertainty and risk, such as information . two main characteristics make real options an appropriate application for IT investments. These characteristics make real option valuation ideal in valuing IOT investment projects, as it can capture value that otherwise would be overlooked. Good managers intuitively understand real options. Real option valuation allows management to quantify these options to more accurately reflect the value of a project and to have a real strategic impact on the value of a project. <a href="#2">Table 2</a> lists four general types of real options. There are several examples of how real options are used in valuation today.

					the probability of success (p) and failure (1-p),
					determine the expected payoffs using the project
					value less the investment amount, and essentially
					work backward to determine the value ofthe option.
			<p>
				<li><div class="A"> <h2><b>Real options example</b></h2></div></li>
			<p>		
					Here we offer an example. A company is looking to
					invest in new smart vending machines that will
					reduce costs and increase profits. Management believes there is a probability of 0.55 that there will be
					a high demand in this technology with a market
					value of $140m, and a probability of 0.45 that there
					will be a low demand in this technology with a
					market value of $40m. <a href="#4">Fig.1</a>shows a decision
					tree without real options.
					If the cost of investing in this technology at time
					zero is $100m and the discount rate is 8%, then from
					a simple NPV calculation the value of the project is
					—$12.04m, which the standard NPV rejects.
					Present Value of Cash In flow
			<img src="image-removebg-preview (2).png" alt="equ." width=300px align="right" >
					However, management can use a real option approach to evaluate this investment as a phased financing and scaling option. The company could start
					with a pilot project and better learn the market over
					time. In the following year, management could avoid
					full investment of $100m into this smart vending
					machine technology if the market turns out to be
					$40m, and only invest in this technology if the
					market turns out to be $140m. Therefore, management can value the option using a decision tree
					that takes the higher value as the exercised
					option. The option value of this project from the
					real option perspective is ($140m — $100m)*0.55 +
					($0m)*0.45 = $22m/(1.08)1 = $20.37m. As long as the
					pilot project costs less than $20.37m, this pilot project with a following investment in the smart vending
					machine technology is worth doing. <a href="#4">Fig.2</a> showsthe option value calculation, discounted back one
					period.
					While this example wassimplified forreadersfrom
					non-finance backgrounds, more complicated scenarios can be analyzed using the same principles.

		<div class="A"> <h1><b>Challenges in IOT development</b></h1></div>
			<p>
				As with any disruptive innovation, the IOT
				will present multiple challenges to adopting enterprises. For example, due to the explosion of data
				generated by IOT machines, Gartner(2014)suggested
				that data centers will face challenges in security, the
				enterprise, consumer privacy, data itself, storage
				management, server technologies, and data center
				networking. This section discusses five technical and
				managerial challenges: data management, data mining, privacy, security, and chaos.
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li><div class="A"> <h2><b>Data management challenge</b></h2></div></li>
						<p>	
							IOT sensors and devices are generating massive
							amounts of data that need to be processed and
							stored. The current architecture of the data center
							is not prepared to deal with the heterogeneous
							nature and sheer volume of personal and enterprise
							data (Gartner, 2014). Few enterprises would be
							able to invest in data storage sufficient to house all
							the IOT data collected from their networks. Consequently, they will prioritize data for operations
							or backup based on needs and value. 
						</p>
					<li><div class="A"> <h2><b>Data mining challenge</b></h2></div></li>
						<p>	
							As more data are available for processing and analysis, the use of data mining tools becomes a necessity.
							Data consist not only of traditional discrete data, but
							also ofstreaming data generated from digitalsensors
							in industrial equipment, automobiles, electrical meters, and shipping crates. These streaming data are
							about location, movement, vibration, temperature,
							humidity, and even chemical changes in the air. Data
							mining tools can invoke corrective processes to address immediate operational issues or inform managers of discoveries regarding competitors’strategic
							moves and customers’ preference changes that
							will impact their short-term and long-term business
							activities.
							Data need to be tamed and understood using
							computer and mathematical models. Traditional
							data mining techniques are not directly applicable
							to unstructured images and video data. Coupled
							with the need for the advanced data mining tools
							to mine streaming data from sensor networks and
							image and video data, there is a shortage of
							competent data analysts. 
						</p>
					<li><div class="A"> <h2><b>Privacy challenge</b></h2></div></li>
						<p>	
							As is the case with smart health equipment and
							smart car emergency services, IOT devices can provide a vast amount of data on IOT users’ location
							and movements, health conditions, and purchasing
							preferences–—all of which can spark significant privacy concerns. Protecting privacy is often counterproductive to service providers in this scenario, as
							data generated by the IOT is key to improving
							the quality of people’s lives and decreasing service
							providers’ costs by streamlining operations. The IOTis
							likely to improve the quality of people’s lives.
							According to the 2014 TRUSTe Internet of Things
							Privacy Index, only 22% of Internet users agreed that
							the benefits ofsmart devices outweighed any privacy
							concerns . 
						</p>
					<li><div class="A"> <h2><b>Security challenge</b></h2></div></li>	
						<p>	
							As a growing number and variety of connected
							devices are introduced into IOT networks, the
							potential security threat escalates. Although the
							IOT improves the productivity of companies and
							enhances the quality of people’s lives, the IOT will
							also increase the potential attack surfaces for hackers and other cyber criminals. A recent study
							revealed that 70% of the
							most commonly used IOT devices contain serious
							vulnerabilities. IOT devices have vulnerabilities
							due to lack of transport encryption, insecure Web
							interfaces, inadequate software protection, and
							insufficient authorization. On average, each device
							contained 25 holes, or risks of compromising the
							home network. Devices on the IOT typically do not
							use data encryption techniques.
							Some IOT applications support sensitive infrastructures and strategic services such as the smart
							grid and facility protection. Other IOT applications
							will increasingly generate enormous amounts of
							personal data about household, health, and financial status that enterprises will be able to leverage
							fortheir businesses. Lack ofsecurity and privacy will
							create resistance to adoption of the IOT by firms and
							individuals. Security challenges may be resolved by
							training developers to incorporate security solutions
							(e.g., intrusion prevention systems, firewalls) into
							products and encouraging users to utilize IOT security features that are built into their devices.
						</p>
					<li><div class="A"> <h2><b>Chaos challenge</b></h2></div></li>	
						<p>	
							The evolution of IOT technologies (e.g., chips,
							sensors, wireless technologies) is in a hyperaccelerated innovation cycle that is much faster
							than the typical consumer product innovation cycle.
							There are still competing standards, insufficient
							security, privacy issues, complex communications,
							and proliferating numbers of poorly tested devices.
							If not designed carefully, multi-purpose devices and
							collaborative applications can turn our lives into
							chaos. In an unconnected world, a small error or
							mistake does not bring down a system; however, in a
							hyper-connected world, an error in one part of a
							system can cause disorder throughout. Smart home
							applications and medical monitoring and control
							systems consist of interconnected sensors and communication devices and controllers. If a sensor of a
							medical monitoring and control system malfunctions, the controller may receive an incorrect signal, which may prove fatal to the patient. It is not
							difficult to imagine smart home kits such as thermostats and residential power meters breaking down or
							being attacked by hackers, creating unexpected
							safety problems. The Internet bandwidth can get
							saturated with data traffic of proliferating devices,
							creating system-wide performance problems. A single device may have an insignificant problem, but
							BUSHOR-1218; No. of Pages 10
							The Internet of Things (IOT): Applications, investments, and challenges for enterprises 9
							for the system as a whole, the chain reactions of
							other connected devices can become disastrous. To
							prevent chaos in the hyper-connected IOT world,
							businesses need to make every effort to reduce
							the complexity of connected systems, enhance
							the security and standardization of applications,
							and guarantee the safety and privacy of users anytime, anywhere, on any device.

		<div class="A"> <h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1></div>
			<p>	
				Because the IOT is such a recent development, there
				is still a paucity of studies on the social, behavioral,
				economic, and managerial aspects of the IOT. This
				makes it very challenging for companies to make
				informed decisions as regards IOT adoption/
				implementation. Our article is one ofthe firststudies
				on a conceptual model of IOT applications for enterprises.In this article we identified three categories of
				IOT applications: monitoring and control, big data
				and business analytics, and information sharing and
				collaboration. We also presented investment opportunities and investment evaluation with NPV and
				real options. Finally, we discussed five challenges
				in implementing IOT applications for enterprises.
